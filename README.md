# PSCPTool
GUI around PuTTY's PSCP

This python script acts as a GUI for PuTTY's SCP functionality (called PSCP).
With this tool, it's possible to upload or download files or folders from or to devices, via Secure Copy (filetransfer via SSH).

Even when Python is not installed, it is still possible to use this GUI, by simply downloading the compiled file (.EXE). This was done with help of the module named PyInstaller.
